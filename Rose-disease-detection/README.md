# Rose-disease-detection
A flask-based website with machine learning yolov8 model


Rose is a vital plant but farmers face loss for not having idle knowledge. We solve it using deep learning Yolov5, Yolov8, VGG16, and InceptionV3 for image detection ï‚§ Feed Forward Neural Network training chatbot using natural language processing. Here we achieved the highest accuracy and efficiency in Yolov8cls model, so Yolov8 model for model deployment, and finally to help easily we created a website
